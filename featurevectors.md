### Corners and Object Detection

Features alone and together: Now, you've seen examples of shape-based features, like corners, that can be extracted from images, but how can we actually uses the features to detect whole objects? Say we want a way to detect this mountain in other images, too. A single corner will not be enough to identify this mountain in any other images, but, we can take a set of features that define the shape of this mountain, group them together into an array or vector, and then use that set of features to create a mountain detector!
