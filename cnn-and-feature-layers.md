### CNN Structure {#cnn-structure}

### A classification CNN takes in an input image and outputs a distribution of class scores, from which we can find the most likely class for a given image. As you go through this lesson, you may find it useful to consult[this blog post](https://cezannec.github.io/Convolutional_Neural_Networks/), which describes the image classification pipeline and the layers that make up a CNN.![](/assets/Screenshot 2019-11-06 at 8.14.16 AM.png)CNN Layers

The CNN itself is comprised of a number of layers; layers that extract features from input images, reduce the dimensionality of the input, and eventually produce class scores. In this lesson, we'll go over all of these different layers, so that you know how to define and train a complete CNN!![](/assets/Screenshot 2019-11-06 at 8.15.12 AM.png)
